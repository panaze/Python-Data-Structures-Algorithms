SOLUTION
In this implementation, the linked list is iterated over using a while loop, with the current variable starting at the head of the linked list and the previous variable starting at None. 
If the current node's value is in the dictionary, it's a duplicate, so the previous node's next attribute is set to the current node's next attribute. 
This effectively removes the duplicate node from the linked list. 
If the current node's value is not in the dictionary, it's added to the dictionary, and the previous variable is set to current. 
Finally, the current variable is set to the current node's next attribute, and the iteration continues until current is None.
