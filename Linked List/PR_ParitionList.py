LL: Partition List (âš¡Interview Question)
You are given a singly linked list implementation in Python that does not have a tail pointer (which will make this method simpler to implement).
You are tasked with implementing a method partition_list(self, x) that will take an integer x and partition the linked list such that all nodes with values less than x come before nodes with values greater than or equal to x. 
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

SOLUTION:
Create two lists one for elements less than x and one for elements greater than x.
Add elements of original list to two new lists.
Eliminate dummy nodes from the two completed lists.
Make the original list head be the list with elements smaller than x.
Get the tail of list with elements smaller than x.
Connect the tail of smaller list to head of the list with greater elements.
