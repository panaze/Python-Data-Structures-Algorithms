LL: Find Kth Node From End (âš¡Interview Question)

Find the item that is a certain number of steps away from the end of the linked list WITHOUT USING LENGTH.

For example, let's say you want to find the item that is 3 steps away from the end of the LL. 
To do this, you would start from the head of the LL and move through the links until you reach the item that is 3 steps away from the end.

This is the problem of finding the "kth node from the end" of a linked list. 
Your task is to write a program that takes as input a linked list and a number k, and returns the item that is k steps away from the end of the list. If the linked list has fewer than k items, the program should return None.

SOLUTION
The find_kth_from_end function takes two parameters: a linked list called ll, and an integer k representing the index of the element to find from the end of the list.
The function initializes two pointers, slow and fast, to the head node of the linked list. 
The fast pointer is then moved k nodes ahead of the slow pointer. 
If the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list before it moves k nodes, that means the linked list is too short to find the kth node from the end of the list, so the function returns None.
Otherwise, the slow and fast pointers are moved one node at a time until the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list. 
The slow pointer will then be pointing at the kth node from the end of the linked list, so the function returns that node.
This function has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the linked list
